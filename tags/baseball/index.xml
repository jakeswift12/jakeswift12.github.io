      <description>I am a big baseball fanatic and one day was thinking to myself about how I would go about managing a team. Sure, every team wants the big hitter that can deliver the big homer. I was thinking about pitching. If I were to start a team tomorrow, which type of pitcher would I want to be more successful? I thought to myselfâ€¦ knuckleball or fastball pitcher? So I have done some research on what type of pitcher you would want in order to start up a successful franchise.</description>
