<p>I am a big baseball fanatic and one day was thinking to myself about how I would go about managing a team. Sure, every team wants the big hitter that can deliver the big homer. I was thinking about pitching. If I were to start a team tomorrow, which type of pitcher would I want to be more successful? I thought to myself… knuckleball or fastball pitcher? So I have done some research on what type of pitcher you would want in order to start up a successful franchise.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>I am importing the necessary libraries in order to create graphs which will show us the history of the knuckleball vs the fastball in Major League Baseball. I have gathered together five of the best knuckleball pitchers the game has ever seen and will compare them to five of the greatest fastball pitchers the game has ever seen.</p>

<p>I am now going to import the data of the 10 pitchers in order to gather the necessary statistics to compare the two types of pitchers.</p>

##   Tm = col_character(),
##   Lg = col_character(),

## )
## i Use `spec()` for the full column specifications.</code></pre>
<p>I will now be comparing the best knuckleball pitchers win percentage throughout their careers to the best fastball pitchers win percentage in order to see who statistically gets more wins. This way you would know which type of pitcher you might want on your team.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + geom_line(data=pitchers, aes(x=Year, y=`W-L%`)) + facet_wrap(~Player)+

Tim Wakefield, R.a. Dickey,Phil Niekro, Charlie Hough and Dutch Leonard are the top knuckleball pitchers of all time. They average about a .516 W-L%. The top fastball pitchers are Roger Clemens, Sandy Koufax, Walter Johnson, Nolan Ryan, and Lefty Grove. They average about a .624 W-L% meaning over the history of the game, the top fastball pitchers win more games over the top knuckleball pitchers.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>I am now creating a dumbbell chart to show the number of strikeouts vs walks for fastball and knuckleball pitchers. One of the keys to baseball that makes a good pitcher is having a solid strikeout to walk ratio so this will tell us which type of pitcher has been historically better in that category.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>totals &lt;- pitchers %&gt;% group_by(Player) %&gt;% summarize(TotalSO = sum(SO), TotalBB=sum(BB))</code></pre>

  colour_xend = &quot;green&quot;
    ) +

As you can see in this chart this group has a bunch of total strikeouts. The green dot on the left indicates walks, while the blue dot on the right indicates strikeouts throughout their careers. The knuckleball group accumulated a total of 10,507 strikeouts to 6,148 walks or about a 10:6 SO/W ratio. The best fastball pitchers accumulated 18,557 strikeouts to 7,742 or about a 18:7 SO/W ratio. Fastball pitchers win again.

I am now creating a scatterplot showing the top knuckleball and fastball pitchers average ERA compared to the MLB average.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + geom_point(data=pitchers, aes(x=`ERA`, y=WHIP,)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=4.26, color=&quot;blue&quot;) + 
  facet_wrap(~Player) + 
  labs(x=&quot;WHIP&quot;, y=&quot;ERA&quot;, title=&quot;Average ERA from the Top\n Knuckleball and Fastball Pitchers&quot;, subtitle=&quot;The blue line is the average ERA by all pitchers over the last 20 years. These pitchers? Way below that.&quot;, caption=&quot;Source: Baseballreference | By Jake Swift&quot;) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = &quot;bold&quot;),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/2021/03/29/knuckleball-vs-fastball/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
As you can see here the pitchers are fairly equal. As you might expect, the top pitchers the game has ever seen are usually going to be better than average.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>In the end I think I would go with a fastball pitcher. Historically, they get more wins, more strikeouts, and give up less runs than knuckleball pitchers do. But hey, the knuckleball is a lot more fun to watch than the average fastball.</p>
